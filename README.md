# Paint_Application
I made this project in 2023 when I was a second year college student. The application was developed using C#, .NET Framework, and WinForms. With this application, you can adjust the size of shapes, select single or multiple shapes (by holding down the Ctrl button), change the properties of the pen and brush, and delete any selected shape.


--NOTE 
+PLEASE SELECTED THE SHAPE ICON EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO DRAW A SHAPE.
+HOLDING CTRL KEY TO SELECT MANY SHAPE AT ONE TIME
